# Proofboard Career Agent installation script for Linux and macOS.
#
# Usage:
#   curl -fsSL https://proofboard.io/install.sh | sh
#
# macOS users: proofboard.io will present `brew install` as the primary
# install path there (avoids the Gatekeeper "unidentified developer" warning
# this script's unnotarized binary can trigger). This script remains the
# fallback / power-user path.
#
# The script resolves the latest published release, verifies the release
# signature, and then hands over to the Career Agent's own installer so the
# executable and the background agent are registered the same way as a manual
# `proofboard install`. The install goes into the current account, so no
# administrator access is required.
#
# Releases are read from proofboard.io first. If that distribution origin is
# unavailable, the script falls back to the latest release published directly
# on GitHub. Private-repository fallback can use PROOFBOARD_GITHUB_TOKEN
# (GH_TOKEN and GITHUB_TOKEN are also honoured), or an authenticated GitHub CLI.
#
# Environment overrides (used by release verification and by pinned installs):
#   PROOFBOARD_VERSION              install a specific tag instead of the latest
#   PROOFBOARD_GITHUB_TOKEN         token used to read releases from the repository
#   PROOFBOARD_LATEST_RELEASE_URL   release manifest URL
#   PROOFBOARD_DOWNLOAD_BASE_URL    directory URL holding the release artifacts
#   PROOFBOARD_INSTALL_VERIFY_ONLY  download and verify, then stop
#   PROOFBOARD_SYSTEM_INSTALL       install for every account (needs sudo)
