    Proofboard Career Agent installation script for Windows.

    Usage:
        irm https://proofboard.io/install.ps1 | iex

    The script resolves the latest published release, verifies the release
    checksum, and then hands over to the Career Agent's own installer so the
    global executable and the background agent are registered the same way as a
    manual `proofboard install`. The install goes into the current account, so
    no administrator access is required. Set PROOFBOARD_SYSTEM_INSTALL=1 to
    install for every account instead, which prompts for administrator access
    through UAC.

    Releases are read from proofboard.io first. If that distribution origin is
    unavailable, the script falls back to the latest release published directly
    on GitHub. Private-repository fallback can use PROOFBOARD_GITHUB_TOKEN
    (GH_TOKEN and GITHUB_TOKEN are also honoured).

    Environment overrides (used by release verification and by pinned installs):
        PROOFBOARD_VERSION              install a specific tag instead of the latest
        PROOFBOARD_GITHUB_TOKEN         token used to read releases from the repository
        PROOFBOARD_LATEST_RELEASE_URL   release manifest URL
        PROOFBOARD_DOWNLOAD_BASE_URL    directory URL holding the release artifacts
        PROOFBOARD_INSTALL_VERIFY_ONLY  download and verify, then stop
        PROOFBOARD_SYSTEM_INSTALL       install for every account (needs UAC)
        PROOFBOARD_INSTALL_DIR          install into a specific directory
